# Chapter 1


This is a story about a subject that's so controversial it will shock my
readers to the very core. That's right. This is a story about cheese.

Everyone hates cheese. It's true. Even so called cheese lovers, if they were
truly being honest with themselves would have to admit it ... Cheese stinks.
Strange as that may sound, this story is about a person who was in denial of
their hatred of cheese. An aforementioned "cheese-lover" to the core. His name
was Brian. As you may have guessed, his favourite type of cheese was Brie - and
I don't mean no fresh-off-the-shelf, garden variety Brie you'd find in your
local supermarket. No, I'm talking about the smelliest, pongiest, stinkiest,
oldest Brie you could ever imagine. 

You see, when Brian was young he was introduced to cheese as part of a
standard, 4-course meal the family enjoyed every Sunday. His father would bring
out the Cheese platter just before desert and Brian would go delerious with
delight. He would run around the table several times, shouting
"cheesey-cheese-sneeze".  It was actually rather annoying for the rest of the
family who found it particularily odd. At the time, nobody knew it but Brian as
actually suffering fron a rare mental illness call chizyphreniosis. We all know
someone who's had it but Brian was level 9 on th e chizyphreniosis spectrum.
